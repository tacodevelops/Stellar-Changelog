Stellar is an OS/Operating System made by a solo Autistic developer, started in 2025, & heavy-progression began early 2026!

Stellar is similar to Linux, with huge amounts of customizability, but similar to Microsoft, with copious amounts of built-in software for completely free!

Current base software for Stellar:

1. Base stuff, settings, files, photos, etc
2. 2d Game Engine (simple, lightweight & offline (no multi-collaboration or multiplayer games!))
3. 3d Game Engine (simple, lightweight & offline (no multi-collaboration or multiplayer games!))
4. An inbuilt code editor with huge amounts of built-in software, Node.js & Flux (as examples)
5. Custom Web Browser, except the browser has 2 options that can be changed at any time! It can be just a base browser, or you can customize it with code & or customization settings!
